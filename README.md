# Star Wars Destiny Card Trader

##Overview :star2:
The overall goal of this application is to allow users to easily traide cards from various tabletop card games.
The application will initially support the Start Wars Destiny Card Game, however others can be added in the future.
Feel free to use this code to create your own applications. Modify and distribute this code however you like. It is 
built on top of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). 

Each user will have a card collection based on a game. This collection is able to be seen by other users where trades can be
initiated. Cards from each users collection can be put on the stack in order to be traded. Other features such as a chat 
or rating feature are further down the pipeline and take a hard second priority to the initially stated functionality.

I'm open to anyone who wants to join or collabortate, I'm an avid tabletop gamer and would love for this to expand to
assist gameplay for a multitude of games.

All Backend functionally is implemented on the [deck_api repo](https://github.com/jstewart0788/deck_api), however this is the
main repository and readme for both. Website available at: <http://www.jonathanstewart.us>

3. [ ] Collection DB / API Routes - Card Collection Backend Infastructure
